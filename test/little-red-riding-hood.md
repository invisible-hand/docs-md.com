# Little Red Riding Hood

## The Journey Begins

Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl who always wore a red hooded cloak. Everyone called her **Little Red Riding Hood**.

One day, her mother said:
- "Take this basket of goodies to Grandma"
- "Don't talk to strangers"
- "Stay on the path through the forest"

## The Wolf in the Woods

As Little Red Riding Hood walked through the forest, she met a wolf.

"Where are you going?" asked the wolf sweetly.

"To my grandmother's house," she replied innocently.

The cunning wolf had an idea. He ran ahead to Grandma's house while Little Red Riding Hood picked flowers.

## At Grandma's House

The wolf reached the house first, locked Grandma in the closet, and disguised himself in her nightgown and cap.

When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange:

> "Grandma, what big eyes you have!"  
> *"All the better to see you with, my dear."*
>
> "Grandma, what big ears you have!"  
> *"All the better to hear you with, my dear."*
>
> "Grandma, what big teeth you have!"  
> *"All the better to eat you with!"*

## The Rescue

Just then, a woodsman heard the commotion and rushed in. He chased the wolf away and freed Grandma from the closet.

Little Red Riding Hood learned to always listen to her mother's advice.

**The End** 🌹
