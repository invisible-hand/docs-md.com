# The Three Little Pigs

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their own houses.

## The First Little Pig

The first little pig was lazy. He built his house out of **straw** because it was quick and easy.

> "This will do just fine!" he said, and went off to play.

## The Second Little Pig

The second little pig built his house out of **sticks**. It took a bit more effort, but he finished quickly too.

## The Third Little Pig

The third little pig was wise and hardworking. He built his house out of **bricks**, even though it took much longer.

## The Big Bad Wolf

One day, a big bad wolf came along. He huffed and he puffed and he blew down the straw house! The first pig ran to his brother's stick house.

Then the wolf huffed and puffed again, and blew down the stick house! Both pigs ran to their brother's brick house.

The wolf huffed and puffed with all his might, but he **could not** blow down the brick house.

### The End

The three little pigs lived safely in the brick house, and the wolf never bothered them again.

*Moral: Hard work and planning pay off in the end.*
