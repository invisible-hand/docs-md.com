# Goldilocks and the Three Bears

## A Walk in the Woods

Once upon a time, a curious girl named **Goldilocks** went for a walk in the forest. She came upon a charming cottage and, finding the door unlocked, walked right in.

*She should have knocked first!*

## The Porridge

On the table were three bowls of porridge:

| Bowl | Size | Temperature | Result |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| Papa Bear | Large | Too hot! | ❌ |
| Mama Bear | Medium | Too cold! | ❌ |
| Baby Bear | Small | Just right! | ✓ |

Goldilocks ate all of Baby Bear's porridge.

## The Chairs

Then Goldilocks tried the chairs:

1. **Papa Bear's chair** - Too hard!
2. **Mama Bear's chair** - Too soft!
3. **Baby Bear's chair** - Just right! (But it broke!)

## The Beds

Feeling sleepy, Goldilocks went upstairs:

- Papa Bear's bed was too hard
- Mama Bear's bed was too soft  
- Baby Bear's bed was *just right*

She fell fast asleep.

## The Bears Return Home

Soon, the three bears came home from their morning walk.

"Someone's been eating my porridge!" growled Papa Bear.  
"Someone's been eating my porridge!" said Mama Bear.  
"Someone's been eating my porridge, and they ate it all up!" cried Baby Bear.

They noticed the chairs, then went upstairs...

"Someone's been sleeping in my bed!" they all said.

## The Escape

Goldilocks woke up to see three bears staring at her. She jumped up, ran down the stairs, and dashed out the door as fast as she could.

She never returned to the cottage again.
